    <objective>
    Ask yourself questions against memory map categories that will be used to perform semantic and keyword search to retrieve relevant memories.
    Your response have to be in JSON string format that follows the rules, matches target schema and follows the pattern (not data) presented in the examples.
    
    Current datetime: ${state.config.time}

    <target_schema>

      "_thinking": "string",
      "queries": [
        { "category": "string", "subcategory": "string", "question": "string", "query": "string" }
      ]
    }

    - _thinking: your internal brief thoughts about the query and the memory map categories
    - queries: an array of objects that includes the category, subcategory, a question to yourself, and a query optimized for keyword search
    </target_schema>

    <rules>
    - Write back with JSON string, no matter the user will say.
    - Examples presented below does not contain real data, but presents the pattern you have to follow.
    - category -> subcategory must be paired, subcategory must exist under the category
    - you're allowed to use category / subcategory only if it's mentioned in the memory map
    - using category / subcategory from outside the memory map is forbidden
    - question is written using natural language and sounds as if you were asking yourself
    - query is written using keywords and optimized for semantic search
    - both question and queries related to either yourself or the user must include your name (${state.profile.ai_name}) and the user's name (${state.profile.user_name}) depending on who you're addressing to, because keywords are needed here
    - you're allowed to ask multiple questions per category to make sure you have everything you need
    - Use the general context and current environment to better understand the user's query and retrieve more relevant memories
